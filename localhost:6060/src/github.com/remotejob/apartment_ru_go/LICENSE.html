<span id="L5" class="ln">     5</span>	 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

<span id="L9" class="ln">     9</span>	
<span id="L10" class="ln">    10</span>	  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
<span id="L11" class="ln">    11</span>	software and other kinds of works.
<span id="L12" class="ln">    12</span>	
<span id="L13" class="ln">    13</span>	  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
<span id="L14" class="ln">    14</span>	to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
<span id="L15" class="ln">    15</span>	the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
<span id="L16" class="ln">    16</span>	share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
<span id="L17" class="ln">    17</span>	software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
<span id="L18" class="ln">    18</span>	GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
<span id="L19" class="ln">    19</span>	any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
<span id="L20" class="ln">    20</span>	your programs, too.
<span id="L21" class="ln">    21</span>	
<span id="L22" class="ln">    22</span>	  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
<span id="L23" class="ln">    23</span>	price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
<span id="L24" class="ln">    24</span>	have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
<span id="L25" class="ln">    25</span>	them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<span id="L26" class="ln">    26</span>	want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<span id="L27" class="ln">    27</span>	free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
<span id="L28" class="ln">    28</span>	
<span id="L29" class="ln">    29</span>	  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
<span id="L30" class="ln">    30</span>	these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
<span id="L31" class="ln">    31</span>	certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
<span id="L32" class="ln">    32</span>	you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
<span id="L33" class="ln">    33</span>	
<span id="L34" class="ln">    34</span>	  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
<span id="L35" class="ln">    35</span>	gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
<span id="L36" class="ln">    36</span>	freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
<span id="L37" class="ln">    37</span>	or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
<span id="L38" class="ln">    38</span>	know their rights.
<span id="L39" class="ln">    39</span>	
<span id="L40" class="ln">    40</span>	  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
<span id="L41" class="ln">    41</span>	(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
<span id="L42" class="ln">    42</span>	giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
<span id="L43" class="ln">    43</span>	
<span id="L44" class="ln">    44</span>	  For the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains
<span id="L45" class="ln">    45</span>	that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&#39; and
<span id="L46" class="ln">    46</span>	authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
<span id="L47" class="ln">    47</span>	changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
<span id="L48" class="ln">    48</span>	authors of previous versions.
<span id="L49" class="ln">    49</span>	
<span id="L50" class="ln">    50</span>	  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
<span id="L51" class="ln">    51</span>	modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
<span id="L52" class="ln">    52</span>	can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
<span id="L53" class="ln">    53</span>	protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software.  The systematic
<span id="L54" class="ln">    54</span>	pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
<span id="L55" class="ln">    55</span>	use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
<span id="L56" class="ln">    56</span>	have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
<span id="L57" class="ln">    57</span>	products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
<span id="L58" class="ln">    58</span>	stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
<span id="L59" class="ln">    59</span>	of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
<span id="L60" class="ln">    60</span>	
<span id="L61" class="ln">    61</span>	  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<span id="L62" class="ln">    62</span>	States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
<span id="L63" class="ln">    63</span>	software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
<span id="L64" class="ln">    64</span>	avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
<span id="L65" class="ln">    65</span>	make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
<span id="L66" class="ln">    66</span>	patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
<span id="L67" class="ln">    67</span>	
<span id="L68" class="ln">    68</span>	  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<span id="L69" class="ln">    69</span>	modification follow.
<span id="L70" class="ln">    70</span>	
<span id="L71" class="ln">    71</span>	                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<span id="L72" class="ln">    72</span>	
<span id="L73" class="ln">    73</span>	  0. Definitions.
<span id="L74" class="ln">    74</span>	
<span id="L75" class="ln">    75</span>	  &#34;This License&#34; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
<span id="L76" class="ln">    76</span>	
<span id="L77" class="ln">    77</span>	  &#34;Copyright&#34; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
<span id="L78" class="ln">    78</span>	works, such as semiconductor masks.
<span id="L79" class="ln">    79</span>	
<span id="L80" class="ln">    80</span>	  &#34;The Program&#34; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
<span id="L81" class="ln">    81</span>	License.  Each licensee is addressed as &#34;you&#34;.  &#34;Licensees&#34; and
<span id="L82" class="ln">    82</span>	&#34;recipients&#34; may be individuals or organizations.
<span id="L83" class="ln">    83</span>	
<span id="L84" class="ln">    84</span>	  To &#34;modify&#34; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
<span id="L85" class="ln">    85</span>	in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
<span id="L86" class="ln">    86</span>	exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &#34;modified version&#34; of the
<span id="L87" class="ln">    87</span>	earlier work or a work &#34;based on&#34; the earlier work.
<span id="L88" class="ln">    88</span>	
<span id="L89" class="ln">    89</span>	  A &#34;covered work&#34; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
<span id="L90" class="ln">    90</span>	on the Program.
<span id="L91" class="ln">    91</span>	
<span id="L92" class="ln">    92</span>	  To &#34;propagate&#34; a work means to do anything with it that, without
<span id="L93" class="ln">    93</span>	permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
<span id="L94" class="ln">    94</span>	infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
<span id="L95" class="ln">    95</span>	computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
<span id="L96" class="ln">    96</span>	distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
<span id="L97" class="ln">    97</span>	public, and in some countries other activities as well.
<span id="L98" class="ln">    98</span>	
<span id="L99" class="ln">    99</span>	  To &#34;convey&#34; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
<span id="L100" class="ln">   100</span>	parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
<span id="L101" class="ln">   101</span>	a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
<span id="L102" class="ln">   102</span>	
<span id="L103" class="ln">   103</span>	  An interactive user interface displays &#34;Appropriate Legal Notices&#34;
<span id="L104" class="ln">   104</span>	to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
<span id="L105" class="ln">   105</span>	feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
<span id="L106" class="ln">   106</span>	tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
<span id="L107" class="ln">   107</span>	extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
<span id="L108" class="ln">   108</span>	work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
<span id="L109" class="ln">   109</span>	the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
<span id="L110" class="ln">   110</span>	menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
<span id="L111" class="ln">   111</span>	
<span id="L112" class="ln">   112</span>	  1. Source Code.
<span id="L113" class="ln">   113</span>	
<span id="L114" class="ln">   114</span>	  The &#34;source code&#34; for a work means the preferred form of the work
<span id="L115" class="ln">   115</span>	for making modifications to it.  &#34;Object code&#34; means any non-source
<span id="L116" class="ln">   116</span>	form of a work.
<span id="L117" class="ln">   117</span>	
<span id="L118" class="ln">   118</span>	  A &#34;Standard Interface&#34; means an interface that either is an official
<span id="L119" class="ln">   119</span>	standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
<span id="L120" class="ln">   120</span>	interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
<span id="L121" class="ln">   121</span>	is widely used among developers working in that language.
<span id="L122" class="ln">   122</span>	
<span id="L123" class="ln">   123</span>	  The &#34;System Libraries&#34; of an executable work include anything, other
<span id="L124" class="ln">   124</span>	than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
<span id="L125" class="ln">   125</span>	packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
<span id="L126" class="ln">   126</span>	Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
<span id="L127" class="ln">   127</span>	Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
<span id="L128" class="ln">   128</span>	implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
<span id="L129" class="ln">   129</span>	&#34;Major Component&#34;, in this context, means a major essential component
<span id="L130" class="ln">   130</span>	(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
<span id="L131" class="ln">   131</span>	(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
<span id="L132" class="ln">   132</span>	produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
<span id="L133" class="ln">   133</span>	
<span id="L134" class="ln">   134</span>	  The &#34;Corresponding Source&#34; for a work in object code form means all
<span id="L135" class="ln">   135</span>	the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
<span id="L136" class="ln">   136</span>	work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
<span id="L137" class="ln">   137</span>	control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#39;s
<span id="L138" class="ln">   138</span>	System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
<span id="L139" class="ln">   139</span>	programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
<span id="L140" class="ln">   140</span>	which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
<span id="L141" class="ln">   141</span>	includes interface definition files associated with source files for
<span id="L142" class="ln">   142</span>	the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
<span id="L143" class="ln">   143</span>	linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
<span id="L144" class="ln">   144</span>	such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
<span id="L145" class="ln">   145</span>	subprograms and other parts of the work.
<span id="L146" class="ln">   146</span>	
<span id="L147" class="ln">   147</span>	  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
<span id="L148" class="ln">   148</span>	can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
<span id="L149" class="ln">   149</span>	Source.
<span id="L150" class="ln">   150</span>	
<span id="L151" class="ln">   151</span>	  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
<span id="L152" class="ln">   152</span>	same work.
<span id="L153" class="ln">   153</span>	
<span id="L154" class="ln">   154</span>	  2. Basic Permissions.
<span id="L155" class="ln">   155</span>	
<span id="L156" class="ln">   156</span>	  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
<span id="L157" class="ln">   157</span>	copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
<span id="L158" class="ln">   158</span>	conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
<span id="L159" class="ln">   159</span>	permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
<span id="L160" class="ln">   160</span>	covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
<span id="L161" class="ln">   161</span>	content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
<span id="L162" class="ln">   162</span>	rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
<span id="L163" class="ln">   163</span>	
<span id="L164" class="ln">   164</span>	  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
<span id="L165" class="ln">   165</span>	convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
<span id="L166" class="ln">   166</span>	in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
<span id="L167" class="ln">   167</span>	of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
<span id="L168" class="ln">   168</span>	with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
<span id="L169" class="ln">   169</span>	the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
<span id="L170" class="ln">   170</span>	not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
<span id="L171" class="ln">   171</span>	for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
<span id="L172" class="ln">   172</span>	and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
<span id="L173" class="ln">   173</span>	your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
<span id="L174" class="ln">   174</span>	
<span id="L175" class="ln">   175</span>	  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
<span id="L176" class="ln">   176</span>	the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
<span id="L177" class="ln">   177</span>	makes it unnecessary.
<span id="L178" class="ln">   178</span>	
<span id="L179" class="ln">   179</span>	  3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
<span id="L180" class="ln">   180</span>	
<span id="L181" class="ln">   181</span>	  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological

<span id="L189" class="ln">   189</span>	is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to

<span id="L192" class="ln">   192</span>	users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of

<span id="L196" class="ln">   196</span>	
<span id="L197" class="ln">   197</span>	  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you
<span id="L198" class="ln">   198</span>	receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
<span id="L199" class="ln">   199</span>	appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;

<span id="L202" class="ln">   202</span>	keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
<span id="L203" class="ln">   203</span>	recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
<span id="L204" class="ln">   204</span>	
<span id="L205" class="ln">   205</span>	  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,

<span id="L259" class="ln">   259</span>	    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as

<span id="L271" class="ln">   271</span>	    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and

<span id="L279" class="ln">   279</span>	    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
<span id="L280" class="ln">   280</span>	    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
<span id="L281" class="ln">   281</span>	    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)

<span id="L292" class="ln">   292</span>	
<span id="L293" class="ln">   293</span>	  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
